0. push.c: pushes an element to the stack
1. pint.c: prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
2. pop.c: removes the top element of the stack
3. swap.c: swaps the top two elements of the stack
4. add.c: adds the top two elements of the stack
5. nop.c:  doesnâ€™t do anything
6. sub.c: subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack
7. div.c: divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack
8. mul.c: multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack
9. mod.c: computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack
10. pall.c: prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack
11. pchar.c: prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
12. pstr.c: prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
